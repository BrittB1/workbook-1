What does all this 'stuff' do? In this file I've listed reminders about certain lines of code so I can recall how they function.
This is basically a personal review sheet so I can practice and recall using proper vocabulary to present my code in a class setting.

**QUESTION 2:**
 This statement has/does the following: declares a var named area with a data type of double, has the Math.PI constant
that is built into the Java math class, has the Math.pow method which raises the base (radius) to the power of the exponent
(2)

Printf outputs a formatted String

**QUESTION 4:**
**%.1f:**
This specifier is for formatting a floating-point number (f stands for "floating-point").
The .1 means that the number will be displayed with one digit after the decimal point.

**%.2f:**
Similar to %.1f, but this one specifies that the number will be displayed with two digits after the decimal point.
%n:
This is a platform-independent newline character. It ensures that the output will move to the next line after printing.
